# Seattle Collide

This project is an opportunity to explore a data driven question of choice, and create resources for communicating insights. The project was created for the Data Science Methods(INFO 370 with Michael Freeman) class at the University of Washington. We have chosen to explore data on the collisions in Seattle for our project.
