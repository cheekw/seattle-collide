# Seattle Collide

This project is an opportunity to explore a data driven question of choice, and create resources for communicating insights. The project was created for the Data Science Methods class (INFO 370 with Michael Freeman) at the University of Washington. We have chosen to explore and analyze data on the collisions in Seattle for our project.
