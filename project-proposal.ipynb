    "Victor: The overarching purpose of our research project is to predict the number of occurrences of collisions in Seattle at specific regions. Collisions are an important issue for both the Seattle population and government. Within the past 10 years approximately $2.6 billion of costs have accumulated due to collisions (9.4% fatality, 4.7% serious injury, 59.3% injury, 17.5% property damage, 8.8% possible injury). Exploring through the data can give insight on high traffic areas that do or do not have collisions and how they are affected by the weather, lighting, road conditions and city infrastructure. With information on potential time and regions of collisions, urban engineers can consider the cost/benefit of city planning, road repairs, and the the resource allocation for specific regions of a city. We are hoping this research will be useful in reducing costs and the number of collisions that occur in Seattle. "

    "Chad: Collisions are a large cause of not only fatality, but traffic backups as well as inconvenient repairs to auto or public property. As such, many ways of creatively leveraging existing data to predict around this issue have been attempted. \n",

    "Our team will focus on predicting counts of collisions, but other research teams have attempted to predict the [probability of accident occuring](http://urbcomp.ist.psu.edu/2017/papers/Predicting.pdf). A study by researchers from the University of Iowa aimed to predict whether an accident would occur or not, in a given hour for a given road segment. They fused many datasets on road, weather, traffic, and human factors as their features to predict on, and also incorporated the spatial structure of the road network. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Another venture in Las Vegas](https://apolitical.co/solution_article/las-vegas-forging-big-data-partnership-predict-traffic-accidents/) has taken this notion even further, by generating predictions for certain ‘high-risk areas’ prone to traffic accidents, and actually beginning to direct responders to these risk areas to make prevention and response more efficient. A pilot program of this approach was initiated by the the Israeli company, Waycare, has been shown to predict traffic accidents in advance with 70% accuracy. The team will pilot this approach in Las Vegas on two highways: the I-15 and US-95. These are two differing types of roadway, the former being a big (tourist) interstate, and the latter a commuter route.\n",

    "Both of these studies have utilized historical data based on crash type, as well as other factors such as environmental or human. These types of data, while they can be real-time, do lack important other features that could also prove to be impactful in predictive analyses. A project close to home, as a [partnership between Microsoft, the UW and the City of Bellevue](https://bellevuewa.gov/UserFiles/Servers/Server_4779004/File/Transportation/Publications/video-analytics-toward-vision-zero-ITE-Journal-article-March-2017.pdf), aims to tackle the issue of more insightful data. They argue that predicting areas prone to traffic collisions based off of crash data, is missing a huge factor of detecting zones that can also lead to near-misses. There are many close calls that occur that will not be represented in logs of crash data, so they are employing a video-digitization mechanism to extract that data. Using streetlight and traffic cam data, they can create a picture of an intersection that tracks speed, direction and behaviour of various vehicle types (cars, buses, bicycles) in order to analyze this granular data encoding near-misses, starts & stops, as well as pedestrian behaviour. \n",

    "Doing our background research on what is going on in this field of predictive analytics excites us to a future where we may be able to understand traffic and accidents and hopefully make everyone's commute a bit safer and easier.\n",

    "Victor: We are am not sure about the statistical and machine learning methods we plan on using to test our hypothesis yet. We may try to experiment and do a bit more research on the methods that others have attempted before making any assumptions on the type of methods that would work best. One previous study on creating on collision prediction model (CPM) seemed to categorize based on the different types of road intersections, in which the collision occurred. They state that \n",
    "\n",
    "“historically, many researchers developed CPMs using conventional linear regression, but more recently it has been demonstrated that conventional linear regression models lack the distributional property to adequately describe collisions. This inadequacy is due to the random, discrete, non-negative, and typically sporadic nature that characterize the occurrence of a traffic collision.” \n",
    "\n",
    "The generalized linear regression modeling (GLM) has offered “the most appropriate and sound approach for developing collision prediction models.” They focused on the expectation of collisions, and the identification of collision prone zones. Due to the non-normal distribution error structure of the data, the approach chosen is usually Poisson or negative binomial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another research paper on macro-level CPM in Vancouver discusses that high collision zones were associated with higher vehicle kilometers travelled, estimating a nonlinear Poisson relationship for fatal and injury collisions. Other works similar to the first study, have discussed the number of intersections. The study in Vancouver also decided to use a negative binomial GLM, categorizing collisions into regions.\n",
    "Another research paper decided to use a Poisson-lognormal model to predict the collision counts. There seems to be a good amount of literature in CPM, where these papers all often discuss based on the categories of property damage only (PDO) and injury and fatal (I + F). These incidents are possibly categorized and modeled seperateley because of the nature of how these incidents occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may decide to train a GLM, but would also like to explore other predictive methods such as neural networks. According to one study, some researchers have suggested the use of Back-Propagation Neural Networks (BPNN) for CPM. The study seems to agree that a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) can be appropriate for the prediction, outperforming the BPNN model.\n",

In order to predict the accident, there are several factors to consider such as temperature, hour of day, population density, wind speed etc. We will look at our data visualization to see the trends, and how well they correlate with the road accidents. Based on the observations, these factors will be used as input to the modeling technique we choose. For the model, the data will be divided into training set using pandas and some other python libraries.\n",

In the University of Iowa study cited above, they describe this issue: “factors causing traffic accidents in large cities with dense population and lower speed limits might be very different from those in rural areas with low population density but high speed limit”. The main point of this is that factors such as weather, road and light conditions may not be sufficient enough to predict all of the variation of rare events such as collisions. We will likely need to develop other ways of adding metadata to our features, by merging in datasets such as neighborhood, streetlight, pedestrian data, etc. "
